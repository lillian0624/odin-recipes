        <li>Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Combine the rinsed rice and water in a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.
        </li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring until the
            sugar and salt are dissolved. Allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture. Let the rice
            cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Place a nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border

        <li>Arrange the fish and vegetables in a line across the center of the rice.</li>

        <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into bite-sized pieces.</li>
